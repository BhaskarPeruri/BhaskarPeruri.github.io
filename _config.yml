  I am a highly motivated individual with a strong background in computer science, blockchain development and security. 
  I've contributed to various projects, including decentralized applications and smart contracts. 
  As a blockchain developer intern at KryptoMerch , I've honed my skills in languages such as Solidity, Reactjs, JavaScript, and Pact,
  and I played a vital role in maintaining stability and security in NFT protocols.
  Additionally, I've participated in blockchain competitions such as web3 CTFs, enhancing my problem-solving abilities and demonstrated various vulnerabilities. 
  I am committed to continuous learning, evident in my certifications in NFT deployment and advanced Solidity. Outside of work, I actively engage in smart contract auditing contests and CTF challenges to further sharpen my skills.
  With a passion for innovation and a dedication to excellence, I am eager to take on new challenges and make meaningful contributions in the ever-evolving field of blockchain technology.
